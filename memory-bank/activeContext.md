# Active Context

## Current Focus:
- Maintaining and updating project documentation to reflect current state.
- Text conversion tools implementation and refinement.
- UI/UX improvements and header simplification.
- Exploring UI scaling options for improved information density and mobile experience.

## Recent Changes:
- Implemented multiple text conversion tools including:
  - Case converters (Upper, Lower, Title, Sentence)
  - Text generators (Bold, Italic, Superscript, Subscript, Underline)
  - Special converters (Base64, Binary, Morse Code, Unicode)
  - Font generators (Discord, Facebook, Instagram)
  - Utility tools (Duplicate Line Remover, Word Frequency Counter)
  - Mirror Text Generator with character reversal and substitution
  - APA Format Converter for academic writing
- Integrated Radix UI components for enhanced UI/UX
- Set up routing and navigation structure
- Removed search functionality and simplified headers in tool components
- Migrated tool components from MainLayout to ToolLayout with header control
- Implemented hideHeader prop in ToolLayout for cleaner tool interfaces
- Added Unicode Text Converter for special character transformations
- Explored and tested a responsive zoom scaling solution for UI density optimization:
  - Implemented CSS transform-based scaling system with variable scale factors
  - Created breakpoints for different device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  - Investigated scaling for overlay components (dialogs, menus)
  - Ultimately reverted changes to reconsider implementation approach

## Next Steps:
- Review and potentially refactor existing tool implementations
- Ensure consistent error handling across all tools
- Add comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance for larger text inputs
- Consider expanding header customization options
- Implement mobile-responsive improvements
- Further explore UI density and scaling options with alternative approaches
- Investigate API-based approaches for handling overlay components

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Component structure is organized by tool type in src/components/tools
- UI components from Radix UI are properly integrated and styled with Tailwind
- Tool headers can be selectively hidden using ToolLayout
- Routing is implemented for tool navigation
- State management is handled at component level
- Font style variations are centralized in fontStyles.ts
- Text conversion tools follow consistent implementation patterns
- CSS transform-based scaling presents challenges with portal-based UI components
- Responsive design needs to account for both main content and overlay elements
