# Active Context

## Current Focus:
- Maintaining and updating project documentation to reflect current state.
- Text conversion tools implementation and refinement.
- UI/UX improvements and header simplification.

## Recent Changes:
- Implemented multiple text conversion tools including:
  - Case converters (Upper, Lower, Title, Sentence)
  - Text generators (Bold, Italic, Superscript, Subscript, Underline)
  - Special converters (Base64, Binary, Morse Code, Unicode)
  - Font generators (Discord, Facebook, Instagram)
  - Utility tools (Duplicate Line Remover, Word Frequency Counter)
  - Mirror Text Generator with character reversal and substitution
  - APA Format Converter for academic writing
- Integrated Radix UI components for enhanced UI/UX
- Set up routing and navigation structure
- Removed search functionality and simplified headers in tool components
- Migrated tool components from MainLayout to ToolLayout with header control
- Implemented hideHeader prop in ToolLayout for cleaner tool interfaces
- Added Unicode Text Converter for special character transformations

## Next Steps:
- Review and potentially refactor existing tool implementations
- Ensure consistent error handling across all tools
- Add comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance for larger text inputs
- Consider expanding header customization options
- Implement mobile-responsive improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Component structure is organized by tool type in src/components/tools
- UI components from Radix UI are properly integrated and styled with Tailwind
- Tool headers can be selectively hidden using ToolLayout
- Routing is implemented for tool navigation
- State management is handled at component level
- Font style variations are centralized in fontStyles.ts
- Text conversion tools follow consistent implementation patterns
