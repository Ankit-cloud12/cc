# Project Progress

## What Works:
- Project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Basic component structure implemented
- Memory bank initialized and maintained
- Text conversion tools implemented:
  - Case conversion tools (Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case, Sentence Case)
  - Text formatting tools (Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, Underline)
  - Special text generators (Superscript, Subscript, Small Text, Wide Text, Mirror Text)
  - Social media fonts (Discord, Facebook, Instagram)
  - Code converters (Base64, Binary, Morse Code, Unicode)
  - Academic tools (APA Format Converter)
  - Utility tools (Duplicate Line Remover, Word Frequency Counter)
- Radix UI components integrated for consistent UI/UX
- Routing system implemented for navigation between tools
- Layout components created for tool organization
- Flexible header control with hideHeader prop
- Simplified tool interfaces with reduced UI clutter
- Unicode text conversion support added
- Tool header control system refined

## What's Left to Build:
- Comprehensive testing suite for all tools
- Performance optimization for large text inputs
- Error boundary implementation
- Loading states and error feedback
- User preferences and settings
- Clipboard integration improvement
- Mobile responsiveness refinement
- Header customization options enhancement
- Additional academic format tools
- Advanced text analysis features

## Current Status:
- Core functionality is operational
- Multiple text manipulation tools are fully implemented
- UI components and styling are in place
- Project structure is well-organized and maintainable
- Tool interfaces streamlined with optional header display
- New text conversion tools successfully integrated

## Known Issues:
- Performance may degrade with very large text inputs
- Some tools may need additional error handling
- Mobile layout needs optimization
- Header control might need refinement for specific use cases
- Unicode conversion edge cases need testing
- Some academic format conversions may need refinement

## Next Milestones:
- Implement testing suite
- Add error boundaries and improve error handling
- Optimize performance for large text inputs
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Add user settings and preferences storage
- Review and potentially expand header customization options
- Expand academic tools suite
- Implement advanced text analysis features
