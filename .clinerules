# Cline Rules and Project Intelligence

This file serves as a dynamic logbook of project-specific rules, patterns, and insights discovered during the development of the "Convert Case Text Tool" project. It will be updated as we learn more about the project and user preferences.

## Initial Observations:
- **Tech Stack:** Project is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. This indicates a modern, component-based approach with a focus on rapid UI development and type safety.
- **Component Library:** The presence of Radix UI suggests an emphasis on accessible and unstyled UI components, allowing for customization with Tailwind CSS.
- **Tool-Based Structure:** The project is structured around individual tools, likely implemented as separate components within the `src/components/tools` directory.
- **UI Components:** Reusable UI components are located in `src/components/ui`, indicating a design system approach.

## To be discovered:
- Specific implementation patterns for text manipulation tools.
- User preferences regarding tool features and UI.
- Project-specific best practices and conventions.
- Efficient workflows for developing and testing new tools.

## Future Updates:
- Document critical implementation paths for different tools.
- Capture user preferences and feedback as they emerge.
- Refine project-specific patterns and best practices.
- Track evolution of project decisions and tool usage.
